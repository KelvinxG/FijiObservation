<h1> Project Overview</h1>
The data entry terminal is a web-based application built using Django that allows users to upload rainfall observation data in CSV or Excel format and visualize the data in a chart. The application uses PostgreSQL as the backend database for storing the observation data.

<h2>Features</h2>
The following features are implemented in the data entry terminal:

<li>File upload: Users can upload CSV or Excel files containing rainfall observation data through a form in the web interface.</li>
<li>Data storage: Uploaded data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Django's built-in ORM.</li>
<li>Data visualization: The application displays a chart of the uploaded rainfall observation data using the Highcharts library.</li>
<li> Timezone support: The observation data is stored in UTC to ensure consistency across timezones. </li>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
The data entry terminal is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern. The Django framework provides a powerful implementation of the MVC pattern, with models representing the data, views handling user interface logic, and controllers (in the form of URL patterns and templates) handling the routing and rendering of content.

<h2>The application consists of the following components:</h2>

<li>Models: The observation data is stored in a PostgreSQL database using Django models. The Observation model represents a single observation, with fields for the time, value, station, and parameter associated with the observation.</li>
<li>Views: The application includes views for uploading data and displaying a chart of the uploaded data. The data upload view handles file uploads and saves the uploaded data to the database. The chart view generates a Highcharts chart of the uploaded data and renders it in a web page.</li>
<li>Templates: Django templates are used to generate HTML pages that display the application's content. The application includes templates for the data upload form, the chart display page, and various other pages and components.</li>
<li>Static files: The application includes static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.) that are served by the Django development server and used to style and enhance the user interface.
Technology stack</li>

<h2>The data entry terminal is built using the following technologies:</h2>

<li>Django: The web framework used to build the application.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL: The relational database used to store the observation data.</li>
<li>Highcharts: The JavaScript charting library used to visualize the observation data.</li>
<li>pandas: The Python library used to parse CSV and Excel files.</li>
<li>psycopg2: The PostgreSQL adapter for Python used to interact with the database.</li>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The data entry terminal is a web-based application built using Django that allows users to upload rainfall observation data in CSV or Excel format and visualize the data in a chart. The application uses PostgreSQL as the backend database for storing the observation data, and includes features such as timezone support and a user-friendly web interface. With its modular architecture and powerful technology stack, the data entry terminal is a versatile and scalable solution for managing and visualizing large amounts of observation data.
